## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    [Answer] 
    The quality of a sample depends on factors such as how it was selected, its size, and whether it accurately reflects the diversity of the target population. 

    If my sampling method, size, and composition align with the target population's diversity, I can expect the sample to be representative. Otherwise, the sample may not fully capture all perspectives, leading to results that might not generalize well across the entire population.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    write your answer here...
    [Answer] 
    Yes. I wish to make some changes to my original survey.
    a. In Question 6, correct "Do" to "Fair" to maintain clarity.
    b. In Question 11, the options should be meaningful descriptions of culture rather than fragmented words.
    c. For Question 8 ("What improvements would you suggest to make the workplace more enjoyable and supportive?"), make it clear that respondents should answer in their own words and provide examples where possible. This helps gather actionable, specific feedback.
    d. For Question 3: "What factors influenced your decision to leave or consider leaving the company?" could be confusing if respondents haven't actually decided to leave or considered it. I rephrase it to:
"If you have considered leaving the company, what factors influenced this consideration? (Select all that apply)"
    e. For Question 4 ("Do you feel you receive adequate support and feedback from your manager?"), consider adding a neutral option like, "Occasionally" between "Sometimes" and "Never" for greater accuracy in responses.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    write your answer here...
    [Answer]
    No, the purpose of this survey likely could not have been fully achieved through an observational study alone. Hereâ€™s why:

    a. Nature of Data Collected

    a1. The survey is designed to gather subjective information about employees' feelings, attitudes, and personal experiences related to their roles, satisfaction, work-life balance, and views on company culture. These insights are internal and personal, which means they cannot be directly observed.
    
    a2. Observational studies can reveal behaviors and patterns but are limited in accessing the underlying thoughts, motivations, or emotional responses that surveys can directly elicit.

    b. Specificity and Direct Feedback

    The survey includes questions that ask employees to evaluate factors like support from managers, opportunities for growth, and job satisfaction. While some of these may be partially inferred from observational data (e.g., productivity levels might reflect satisfaction to an extent), direct feedback provides clarity and context that observations cannot achieve.

    c. Purpose of the Survey

    The survey aims to understand employeesâ€™ experiences and perceptions, which often require self-reporting. Employees might feel more comfortable sharing their honest opinions in a survey format, especially if it is confidential, rather than having these inferred indirectly.

    An observational study alone would miss the nuanced understanding of employees' attitudes, motivations, and suggestions for improvement that are essential to the survey's purpose. Thus, a survey approach is better suited to fulfill these objectives.
